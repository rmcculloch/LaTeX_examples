%This .tex file demonstrates how to do references in LaTeX.
%It requires compiling with BibTex as well as LaTeX.
%BibTex references an external bibliography library/database with .bib
%extension.
%A good cross-platform tool for creating and storing your bibliography is
%jabref. This can be installed through your Linux package manager.
%To set up your database, open jabref and click file > New database. To add a
%reference, click the plus sign then select the reference type (article, book,
%etc}. You can either manually enter the information and will need to fill in
%all the required fields. There are also optional fields, a place to add the
%abstract as well as even attach the entire article as a .pdf. This is handy as
%you can also use jabref to manage and access all your actual references.
%A better way of adding references is by pasting in the formatted code in the
%BibTeXsource tab. You need to remove the existing starter code already there or
%add a comma to the end of it, paste in your reference code and then remove the
%first line of the code you pasted. The code can obtained from various
%reference sources, e.g. the journals themselves, Google Scholar, etc. For
%example, the reference you find on Google Scholar will have a cite link and
%then a BibTeX link. You then simply copy the code and paste it under the
%BibTeXsource link in jabref and save it. Every reference requires a BibTeXkey
%which it will probably already have unless you're entering the reference
%manually. The location of the key is at the bottom of the Required fields tab.
%Regardless of whether the reference has a key or not, click on the magic wand
%icon and a new key will be generated automatically. It is likely to be better
%than the existing key you've imported so it's recommended doing this for every
%reference.
%To successfully compile the document, the following steps are required:
%1) pdflatex file.tex
%2) bibtex file.aux
%3) pdflatex file.tex
%4) pdflatex file.tex
% The first compile will display errors about the references. This is normal. It
% will also produce a file.aux which you need to run bibtex. Two further
% file.tex compilations are required to link up and display everything
% correctly.
