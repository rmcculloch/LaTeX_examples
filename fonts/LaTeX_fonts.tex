%There are a number of packages that allow you to change the fonts used by
%Latex. Probably the best option is to use the fontspec package that allows you
%to access and control the use of any font on your system. When using fontspec,
%you need to compile your .tex file with either xelatex or lualatex. Fontspec
%assumes utf8 so you shouldn't load inputenc and save your .tex files as utf8
%which is often the default anyway. The fontspec package is quite involved and
%well documented. Refer to fontspec.pdf for the details.
\usepackage{fontspec}

%This sets the main font for the document. By specifying the font by name (as
%below), the system will automatically access the correct fonts for boldface and
%italics if they are available. You can also specify the specific font file.
%This is more involved, but allows more fine-grained control if, for example,
%the typeface/font family you're interested has a broad range of fonts and you
%have to be sure the system is selecting the correct ones. Again, refer to
%fontspec.pdf for the details. One of the hardest things is determining the
%correct name to use as it very often differs from the file names. There are a
%number of ways to do this, but I found the easiest way is to install a font
%manager such as Font Manager (on Linux). When you open this application, it
%will search your system and automatically include all of your fonts. You can
%then easily see the font names you need and scroll through and view what they
%look like. One thing to keep in mind is that some of the fonts that display in
%Font Manager might not be available to LaTeX. Fontspec will look in the
%/usr/share/fonts directory (and any subdirectory) for the font name or file
%that you've specified. I believe it also looks in the user's texmf directory.
%So if you want the font to be available, make sure you copy the relevant file/s
%within one of these directories. The system-wide directory is probably better
%as the fonts will also be available to other applications. Another way to find
%the font name is to open your word processor (e.g. Libre Office) and read the
%names from the font drop-down selection box. Another way (for open type fonts)
%is to enter `otfinfo -a fontfilename.otf` and it will output the font name. Not
%sure about truetype and other font types, but there are probably other command
%line utilities if you wish to go this way.
