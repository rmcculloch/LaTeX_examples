%This .tex document demonstates how to render new lines.
\documentclass[11pt]{article}

\begin{document}

There are a number of ways to get text to print out on a new line.\\
One method is to use the double backslash which forces the text on to
a new line.\newline
The other way of doing the same thing is to use backslash newline.

You can also leave a blank line which forces the text onto a
new line. The difference with this method is the new line will be indented as if
starting a new paragraph.

\end{document}

%Note that you can use \noindent at the start of a paragraph to avoid it auto-
%indenting.
