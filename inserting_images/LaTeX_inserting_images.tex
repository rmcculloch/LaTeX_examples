%Below we make use of the graphicx package.
%Note that it doesn't work on the standard .dvi build. You need to compile
%using pdflatex.
%Image names should not include spaces. If they do, you will need to encapsulate
%them in double quotes.
%This is considered the best way as you're controlling the width of the image in
%proportion to the textwidth. Too much guess work in the other methods.
